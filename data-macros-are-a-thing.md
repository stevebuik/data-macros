# _Data Macros_ are a thing

Who knows if the term **Data Macro** will stick but it makes sense.

A Clojure macro expands code \(data\) so anything that expands data can be called a macro as well.

But which expansion mechanism is best? What does **best** mean?

* Transform Readability
* Transform Safety i.e. shape conformance checks
* Transform Versatility i.e. supports many input and output shapes

**Note**: not rating data/DSL readability because that is part of a specific app design, not a generalised design or idea.
