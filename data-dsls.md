# Terse data DSLs are a natural solution

The terse forms of these data structures are becoming a common practice. Some examples:



| System | DSL | Expansion Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Vase \(declarative APIs\) | Datomic Schema | Reader Macros |
| Pedestal Routes | Terse, Table, Tree and Verbose | expand-routes fn and Protocols |
| Yada Routes | Bidi | merge with Yada resources |



The expansion mechanisms are very different. Why?

**Which expansion mechanism is best? **That's the main question in this presentation.
